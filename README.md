#**What’s this game all about**
Master of Shadows is an action stealth survival FPS in which you must try to escape a complex set of rooms with increasing difficulty in order to survive the challenges offered by “The Mentor”. 
You are a student in a rigorous “Unreal” training and you must train hard to defeat your master “Ben, aka. The Mentor”.

The challenges include enemy AI, a few sets of traps that could alert our enemies, few ammo resources and you must be clever in order to go through our challenges or die trying. 

You get points for killing your enemies but if you kill them unnoticed you will get more points, at each checkpoint you can cash those points for valuable items to help you continue through the next sections ahead.

The conditions to pass to the next sections are:
AI haven’t seen the player
All AI enemies are dead
